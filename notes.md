# Optimization

The `v8-native` package wraps some `%` V8 native functions. See [this](https://github.com/Nathanaela/v8-Natives/blob/master/lib/v8-native-calls.js) for its list.  Invoke node with `--allow-natives-syntax` to enable.

Invoke node with `--trade-opt` and `--trace-dopt` to see the JIT optimizer at work.
